Paradise, an old Gold Rush town tucked in the Sierra Nevada foothills, lies 100 miles north of Sacramento and less than 15 miles from here. Sister communities, we are connected by the Skyway, a four-lane, winding road. Itâ€™s the daily commute for thousands and the sole route out of Paradise into Chico, the nearest urban area.
